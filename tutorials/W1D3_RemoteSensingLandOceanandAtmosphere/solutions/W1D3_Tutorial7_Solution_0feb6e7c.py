1. The low correlation between the La Ni単a phase and precipitation suggests that there is not a strong relationship between the two. However, the stronger and more significant correlation between El Ni単o and precipitation anomalies suggests that there is a more robust relationship between the two. This aligns with our physical understanding of how atmospheric convection and therefore precipitation is affected which we learned about in Day 2.
2. It does. In the time series, we note that when there are peaks in the ONI, indicating an El Ni単o phase, there are generally peaks in the precipitation anomaly as well. However, for La Ni単a events, when there are troughs in the ONI data, there is much less agreement with the precipitation anomalies.
