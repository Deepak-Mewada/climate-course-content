1. Generally the difference is negative in the Northern Hemisphere and positive in the Southern Hemisphere.
2. The hemispheres have opposing signs, which is because of Earth's tilt and how it affects the timing of the seasons in each hemisphere (i.e. Northern Hemisphere summer is Southern Hemisphere winter). In the Northern Hemisphere, the difference is negative because the Northern Hemisphere July is warmer than the Northern Hemisphere January. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite is true.
3. The ITCZ shifts with the seasons. When the Sun is directly overhead at the Northern Tropics (June), the ITCZ moves northwards, and when the Sun is directly overhead at the Southern Tropics (December), the ITCZ shifts southwards. This migration can affect the distribution of rain, leading to wet and dry seasons in many tropical regions.
