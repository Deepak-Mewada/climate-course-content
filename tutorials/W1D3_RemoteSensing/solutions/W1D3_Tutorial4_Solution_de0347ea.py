1. Aside from the rainforested areas like the Amazon, southern Africa, and Indonesia the error on land is relatively low. Over the ocean, the error seems to be concentrated in rain belts such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone you learned about on day 1 of this week, as well as over regions like the Gulf Stream area. The error of the ocean is generally higher than that of the land.
2. This is a difficult question to answer. Numerous things affect the variability of precipitation estimate errors. This can include the rain regime (e.g. deep convection), the time of the year, the terrain, and having observations to validate the data (which are more limited over the ocean) among other uncertainties.
