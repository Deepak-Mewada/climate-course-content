1. In general when there is a recorded ENSO event in the ONI, there is an agreement with the coral records.  During El Niño Phases captured by the ONI (where SSTs are anomalously warm), we typically see a more negative d18O and vice versa for La Niña events.
2. ENSO is an interannual occurrence, happening every 2-7 years. Within the d18O records, there are high-frequency signals. One thing (among many) we could do is remove these by filtering. This would help resolve our dataset into something more comparable to what the ONI is tracking.
